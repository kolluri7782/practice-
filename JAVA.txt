1) What is class in java ?
  Java class file is a file containing Java bytecode that can be executed on the Java Virtual Machine.
 A Java class file is usually produced by a Java compiler from Java programming language source files containing Java classes.
 ............................
 
 
2)What is object in java ?
A Java object is a member (also called an instance) of a Java class. 
Each object has an identity, a behavior and a state.
 The state of an object is stored in fields (variables), while methods (functions) display the object's behavior. 
 Objects are created at runtime from templates, which are also known as classes.
 .........................
	
3) What is Method?
   In java, a method is like function i.e. used to expose behaviour of an object 
   it may be inside the class or out side the class. 
   Advantage of Method:
   •	Code Reusability
   •	Code Optimization
.....................................

4)Local variables . variables defined inside methods, constructors or blocks are called local variables.
    The variable will be declared and initialized within the method and the variable will be destroyed when the method has completed.
.................................. 

5)Instance variables . Instance variables are variables within a class but outside any method.
    These variables are instantiated when the class is loaded. Instance variables can be accessed from inside any method,
	constructor or blocks of that particular class.
 .....................................
 
6)Class variables . Class variables are variables declared with in a class, outside any method, with the static keyword
.....................................

7)What is Polymorphism?
Polymorphism in Java is a concept by which we can perform a single action in different ways.
There are two types of polymorphism in Java: compile-time polymorphism and runtime polymorphism.
 We can perform polymorphism in java by method overloading and method overriding.
.....................................

8)what is inheritence?
Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object.
 It is an important part of OOPs (Object Oriented programming system).
 .......................................
 
9)Abstraction in Java
Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.
Another way, it shows only essential things to the user and hides the internal details,
 for example, sending SMS where you type the text and send the message. You don't know the internal processing about the message delivery.
 .........................................
 
10)what is encapsulation
 Encapsulation in Java is a process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit,
 for example, a capsule which is mixed of several medicines.
 .....................................
 
 11)What is Method Overriding?
 If subclass (child class) has the same method as declared in the parent class, it is known as method overriding in Java.
 ..........................................
 
 12)What is method overloading?
 If a class has multiple methods having same name but different in parameters, it is known as Method Overloading.
......................................... 

 13) Final Keyword?
 The final keyword in java is used to restrict the user. The java final keyword can be used in many context. Final can be:
variable
method
class
..........................................

14)What is identifier ?
   A name in java program is called identifier it can be a class name variable name or method name or label name 
   java allows only ( a to z,A TO Z,0 TO 9,-,$) for identifiers 
   Java identifiers are case sensitive 
   There is no length limit but recomended to use not morethan 15
   Java identifiers are case sensitive 
   Reserved words can not be used as identifiers 
   
  .....................................................
  
15)Data Types 
     IN java every variable and every expression have some type 
	 Each and every data type is clearly defined
	 Every assignment should be checked by compiler for type compatability 
	 because of above reasons we can conclude java language is  strongly typed language 
Primitive data types 
    @Numeric data types - used to Represent numbers 
	   .Integral data types -To represent whole numbers 
	   *BYTE  - Size - 8bits=1 byte , Range = -128 to 127 
	   *SHORT - Size - 2 bytes ,      Range =  -32768 to 32767
	   *Int   - Size - 4 bytes ,      Range =
	   *LONG  - Size - 8 bytes 
	@Floating point data types - To represent real numbers
	   *Float-   Size -4 bytes 
       *Double - size -8 bytes	   
	@char data types    - To represent characters 
	
	@Boolean data types - To represent logical values 
	  The only allowed characters for boolean data types are True / False 
...............................................
16)Reserved Words
  In java we cant use reserved words as identifiers 
   Ex ;   int x=10
          int if =20
          if is a reserved word in java so we cant use	
		   examples of reserved words :
         abstract, if, private, this, double, implements, throw, boolean, else, 
         import, public, throws, break, return, byte, extends, int, 
         short, true, false, case, interface, static, try, catch, final, long, void.
		 
		 Total reserved word =53
		 @ Keywords=50 
		     Used -48
			 unused -2  goto,constructor
		 
		 Reserved literals =3  True,false,null
		 
	@Keywords for data types =8
	   byte,short,int,long,float,double,boolean,char
	@Key word for flow control = 11
	   if,else,switch,case,default,while,do,for,break,continue,return
	@Keywords for modifications  =11
	  Public,private,protected,static,final,abstract,synchronized,native,strictfp,transient,volatile,
	@	Keywords for exception handling  =6
	   Try ,catch ,finally,throw,throws,assert 
	@Class related keyword = 6
	  class,interface,extends ,implements,package,import,
	@Object related keywords =4
	  new,instanceof,super,this,
	@void return type keyword =1   a method wont return 
	  void 
	  @Enum 
	    enum keyword is used to define group of named constants 
		
All 53 Reserved words in java are  in lowercase and only in alphabets
	  
	
	
		 
....................................................		 

17)Types of variables  
   based on the type of value represented by a variable all variables are divided into 2 types   
     * Primitive variables 
	 *Reference variables 
	 
	@primitive variables : can be used to represent values 
	 int x =10;
	@ Reference variables :can be used to refer objects 
	   student S = new student ();
	   S = referwnce variable
	 Based on purpose and position of decleration all variablesare classified into 3 types 
	 *Instance variable 
     *static variable 
     *local variables 
			 
	@Instance variable : 
	   *If the value of variable is varied from object to object such type of variable is called instance variable 
	   *For every object a seperate copy of instance variable  will be created 
	   *The scope of the instance variable is exactly same as the scope of the objects 
	   because instance variable will be created at the time of object creation and deleted at the time of object deltetiion
	 @ Static variable: Also known as class variable 
	  Class variables are variables declared with in a class, outside any method, with the static keywords
	   
	@Local variables . variables defined inside methods, constructors or blocks are called local variables.
    The variable will be declared and initialized within the method and the variable will be destroyed when the method has completed.

18) What are literals 
   Any constant value which can be be assigned to the variable is called Literals
